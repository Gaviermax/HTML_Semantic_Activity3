                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>For the sixth generation, Honda split the Accord into three separate models, designed for the Japanese, North American, and European markets. However, the wagon was discontinued in North America while the coupe was discontinued in Japan. This generation also spawned two distinctively branded performance versions for European and Japanese domestic markets, dubbed Type R and Euro R, respectively.</p>
                <p>On the origin of these models, it is rumored[1] that with the advent of the sixth generation Accord, "Honda England were let loose to build a car that would compete with Subaru and Mitsubishi's Evo. They came up with the Accord Type R, a lightened (around 1200 kg) track version with no sound deadening or luxuries". Honda Japan followed suit in 2000, "took the Accord Type R and developed the Accord Euro R (hence the 'Euro'pean tag)" which has a similar chassis, suspension that is interchangeable with the European model, same engine (slightly detuned for European Type R), and nearly identical interior trim.</p>
